## Version 1.0

  # First version available at CRAN. It includes ADF, KPSS, HEGY, and CH tests, as well as some
      graphics. Several utilities, such as a graphical user interface, and tables in LaTeX format
      are also implemented.

## Version 1.1

  # DESCRIPTION file has been corrected. uroot does NOT still include functions related to
      structural or periodic models.
  # A bug in seasonal box plot for quarterly series has been fixed. Parameter las=2 has been
      also changed to las=1.
  # A bug in HEGY and CH recursive testing has been fixed. The partition of the sample sometimes
      looked for periods out of the sample, becoming the funtion trapped in a loop with no end.
