### Version 1.0  November 26, 2004 (Submitted to CRAN on January 12, 2005)

  # First version available at CRAN. It includes ADF, KPSS, HEGY, and CH tests, as well as some
      graphics. Several utilities, such as a graphical user interface, and tables in LaTeX format
      are also implemented.

### Version 1.1  February 3, 2005

  # DESCRIPTION file has been corrected. uroot does NOT still include functions related to
      structural or periodic models.

  # A bug in seasonal box plot for quarterly series has been fixed. Parameter las=2 has been
      also changed to las=1.

  # A bug in HEGY and CH recursive testing has been fixed. The partition of the sample sometimes
      looked for periods out of the sample, becoming the funtion trapped in a loop with no end.

### Version 1.2

  # Recursive testing had still problems when the first subsample has few observations with regard
      to the number of parameters. Criterium for selecting a top number of lags has changed to
      another one that tends to select a lower initial order. In particular, in functions
      AICBICaux, selecPv2, selecPv3, selecPv4, and TablaDet, the parameter
      "bp = round(10*log10(N))" has changed to "bp = round(12*(N/100)^0.5)". For next versions,
      it will be pondered on letting the user make this choice.

  # "round(4*(N/100)^0.25)" has been changed to "round(s*(N/100)^0.25)" in computation for the
     covariance matrix in CH test.

  # The function to extract the t-statistic from an lm object, called contts, has been changed. The
    function vcov is now used so that there is no need to invert a matrix.

  # Initial values for non-linear estimates in the function perdiff are set out as the coefficients entailed
    in the model when it is treated as if it were lineal. A summary of the nls estimation is also added.

  # The auxiliar function Tround has been modified. It rounds numbers in such a way that if the last decimal
    equals to zero, that zero is printed, hence, all the numbers in tables that are exported to a LaTeX format
    will display the same number of decimals.

  # Labels for significance in the HEGY recursive F-test when compdet=c(1,0,1) has been defined properly.

  # Argument "s" has been removed from "quarterg" and "bbmp".

  # "Makefiltra" has been added. It allows to transform the series removing the selected cycles. It creates a list object
    with the filtered time series and adds an item in the tree widget.
