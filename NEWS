Version 2.0-6 2017-01-05
-------------------------

  o A cleanup script has been added.

  o GNU make is no longer a SystemRequirements.
    Include files are used in order to avoid the 'ifeq' GNU make extension,
    this makes Makevars more portable.

  o The configure script creates now appropriate environment variables 
    when it detects that it is running on the ARINA cluster of the UPV/EHU.

Version 2.0-5 2016-03-18
-------------------------

  o Based on an older version of package uroot.
    This version provides the CH test for seasonal stability and
    the HEGY test for seasonal unit roots. The functions that implement 
    these tests have been coded from the scratch in order to include the  
    following new features:
    1) the tests are applicable to series of any seasonal periodicity,
    2) p-values based on response surface regressions are available for both tests,
    3) bootstrapped p-values are available for the HEGY test.
